astgen - A tool for creating Abstract Syntaxt Trees
===================================================

This tools allows language and compiler developers to generate Abstract Syntax Trees that can be 
used by parsers (or parser generators) to record the result of a parse phase.   The input is a set
of python classes which describe the methods and members of the AST classes specific to the parser
and outputs language specific (so far Java and C++) classes with the definitions of the various
AST classes.
